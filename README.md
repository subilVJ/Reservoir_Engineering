## How Many Barrels of Water Coming into Our Reservoir? (+Python Tutorial)

The presence of a water aquifer is very important in a reservoir. It is a source of energy that drives the hydrocarbon out for production and slows down pressure depletion. Because of this, a water-drive reservoir has a larger recovery. The entrance of water from the aquifer is known as an aquifer influx. The phenomenon of aquifer influx is a very natural phenomenon that occurs because of material balance: "What comes out first, is replenished later."

Aquifer influx is a very important consideration in many aspects of reservoir engineering, mainly in material balance analysis and reservoir simulation. In material balance analysis, the calculation of Original Oil in Place (OOIP) or Original Gas in Place (OGIP) could be misleading if the aquifer influx is neglected. In the same way, during reservoir simulation, history matching needs the knowledge of aquifer influx.

Three mathematical models were developed, the oldest by Schilthuis in 1936, then by van Everdingen and Hurst in 1949, and by Fetkovich in 1971. These models are used to calculate the amount of water influx from the reservoir with a given production data.

## Schilthuis
In 1936, Schilthuis devised a steady-state approach to perform this task. In his method, due to the assumption of steady-state condition, the rate of water influx is assumed proportional to pressure drawdown. In this model, it is recommended that the OOIP or OGIP should have been determined from the volumetric.
